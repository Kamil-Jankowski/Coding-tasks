== This repository contains coding tasks and excercises for job interviews.

=== Task 1: Find the missing number in the array
You are given an array of positive numbers from 1 to n, such that all numbers from 1 to n are present except one number x.
You have to find x. The input array is not sorted. Look at the below array and give it a try before checking the solution.

*Runtime Complexity*: Linear, _O(n)_

*Memory Complexity*: Constant, _O(1)_
